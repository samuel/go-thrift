Thrift Package for Go

Overview
--------

So why another thrift package? While the existing one
([thrift4go](https://github.com/pomack/thrift4go/)) works well, my philosophy
is that interfaces should match the language. Most Thrift libraries try
to match the API of the original which makes them awkward to use in
other languages.

As an example, Go already has the idea of a thrift transport in the
ReadWriteCloser interfaces.

Another design decision was to keep the generated code as terse as possible.
The generator only creates a struct and the encoding/decoding is done through
reflection. Annotations are used to set thrift ID for a field and options such
as 'required'.

Example struct:

    type User struct {
        Id        int64    `thrift:"1,required"`
        Name      string   `thrift:"2"`
        PostCount int32    `thrift:"3,keepempty"`
        Flags     []string `thrift:"4"`
        SomeSet   []string `thrift:"5,set"`
    }

Types
-----

Most types map directly to the native Go types, but there are some
quirks and limitations.

* Go supports a more limited set of types for map keys than Thrift
* To use a set define the field as []type and provide a tag of "set":

        StringSet []string `thrift:"1,set"`

* Unsigned types aren't supported. Thrift only has signed types. Could
  encode/decode unsigned types as their signed counterparts, but I
  decided against that for now.
* []byte get encoded/decoded as a string because the Thrift binary type
  is the same as string on the wire.

RPC
---

The standard Go net/rpc package is used to provide RPC. Although, one
incompatibility is the net/rpc's use of ServiceName.Method for naming
RPC methods. To get around this the Thrift ServerCodec prefixes method
names with "Thrift".

### Transport

There are no specific transport "classes" as there are in most Thrift
libraries. Instead, the standard `io.ReadWriteCloser` is used as the
interface. If the value also implements the thrift.Flusher interface
then `Flush() error` is called after `protocol.WriteMessageEnd`.

_Framed transport_ is supported by wrapping a value implementing
`io.ReadWriteCloser` with `thrift.NewFramedReadWriteCloser(value)`

### Parser & Code Generator

The "parser" subdirectory contains a Thrift IDL parser, and "generator"
contains a Go code generator. It could be extended to include other
languages in the future.

How to use the generator:

    $ go get github.com/samuel/go-thrift/generator

    $ generator --help
    Usage of parsimony: [options] inputfile outputfile
      -go.binarystring=false: Always use string for binary instead of []byte
      -go.json.enumname=false: For JSON marshal enums by name instead of value
      -go.packagename="": Override the package name
      -go.pointers=false: Make all fields pointers

    $ mkdir $GOPATH/src/cassandra
    $ generator cassandra.thrift $GOPATH/cassandra/thrift.go

    # Then can import "cassandra"
